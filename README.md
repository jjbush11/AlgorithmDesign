## Depth First Search
The Graph class represents an undirected graph and includes methods for adding nodes, adding edges, printing the graph, and performing a Depth-First Search to find the smallest cycle in the graph

## Dijkstra's Alogirthm
The Graph class represents a weighted undirected graph. The graph can be used to find the shortest paths between nodes using two different methods: a standard implementation and an implementation utilizing a Priority Queue.

## Longest Common Subsequence 
The Analyzer class implements a solution for finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two given strings using dynamic programming.
